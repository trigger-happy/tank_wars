Requirements:
The project requires the presence of several libraries and tools in order to
compile. The following is a list of those requirements:
	-boost 1.44+
	-NVidia CUDA 3.2
	-gcc 4.4 or higher
	-CMake 2.8
	-ClanLib 2.2.5
	-kyotocabinet 1.2.25 or higher

Compilation steps:
The assumption is that the tools are already in path and in standard installation
locations. CUDA's default installation is in /usr/local/cuda while boost and
ClanLib may be installed in the /usr or /usr/local prefix. Once these are all in
place, compiling the application involves the following steps

cd /path/to/project/dir
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make

Assuming there were no errors, the following programs shouls appear in the build
directory:

evolver - The application that handles the evolutionary process
genetic_diff - A simple tool to compare 2 gene databases for any differences
geneview - A tool for evaluating any individual available in the gene database
query_gene - A small tool used for debugging to check for genetic values in the db
simview - A tool that shows exactly what happened during the evolution process
	for a particular individual. This is useless unless the project is compiled
	with the SAVE_SIM_DATA flag uncommented in ievolver.h
tank_game - A simple game where you get to try and shoot at any individual in
	the db yourself.

Running the program is best done from the command line and with the current
working directory set to the project directory. So if one wants to run the
tank_game application, the following commands should be done:

cd /path/to/project/dir
build/tank_game

Each of the tools may accept a --help parameter to show you the available
arguments. For questions, e-mail me at:
